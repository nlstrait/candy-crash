## Current Progress:

We are working on seperating the model part and the view part of this application to make them a client and a server respectively in a network application. The view as the server is responsible for passing the initial game instatnce to the model and update the window. The model as the client is responsible for generating all the possible moves and inflict graivty, then pass the updated gameinstacne back to the server.                                                   </br>
